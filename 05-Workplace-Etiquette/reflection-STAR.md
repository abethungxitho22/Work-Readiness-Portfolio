Demonstrate appropriate communication behavior, particularly in email and online interactions.

Learn how to manage workplace situations such as handling rude messages or requesting to leave early.

I completed the Workplace Etiquette Quiz, scoring 100% after reviewing questions carefully.

I studied how to handle sensitive workplace scenarios â€” such as dealing with rude emails calmly and professionally.

I learned about the importance of punctuality, arriving before meeting start times, and maintaining confidentiality.
