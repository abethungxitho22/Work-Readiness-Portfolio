# STAR Reflection: Business Communication

## üéØ Situation

### Context and Background

At the beginning of the PRP370S module in early 2025, I was required to develop professional business communication skills as part of my work readiness training. As a final-year Diploma in Information and Communication Technology student at Cape Peninsula University of Technology, I recognized that technical skills alone would not be sufficient for success in the IT industry.

**Initial Position:**
Prior to this training, my communication style was predominantly casual and informal, suitable for personal interactions and peer communication but inadequate for professional business contexts. I had limited experience with:
- Formal email correspondence
- Professional business writing
- Understanding appropriate tone for different audiences
- Virtual meeting etiquette and professionalism

**The Challenge:**
The IT industry requires strong communication skills alongside technical competencies. Professionals must communicate effectively with clients, colleagues, management, and stakeholders from diverse backgrounds. I needed to transition from academic and casual communication to professional business communication standards.

**Specific Context:**
During October 2025, I received a real professional opportunity - an interview invitation from CAPACITI for their Demand-Driven Graduate Programme. This situation required immediate application of business communication skills in a high-stakes, real-world context. My initial response to a recruiter was informal and contained grammatical errors, highlighting the gap between my current skills and professional requirements.
