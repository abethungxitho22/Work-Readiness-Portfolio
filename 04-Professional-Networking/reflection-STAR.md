# STAR Reflection: Professional Networking
## Situation

As a final-year IT student in the Diploma in ICT at Cape Peninsula University of Technology, I needed to strengthen my professional networking skills to prepare for real-world career opportunities. The PRP370S module emphasized the importance of building an online professional presence through platforms like LinkedIn and developing connections with people in my field.

Before this activity, I had limited networking experience and was not actively engaging on LinkedIn. This task gave me the opportunity to create a complete professional profile and understand how networking contributes to long-term career growth.

## Task

The main objectives were to:

Understand the purpose of professional networking.

Create a LinkedIn profile that reflects my personal brand and professional identity.

Learn the “Golden Rule” of networking — giving value before expecting opportunities.

Avoid common networking mistakes such as lack of preparation or self-centered communication.

Build and maintain authentic professional relationships within the IT industry.

## Action

To complete this task:

I completed the Professional Networking quiz, achieving a 100% score and demonstrating strong theoretical understanding.

I created and optimized my LinkedIn profile, including a professional profile photo, headline, and a detailed “About Me” section.

I added my academic background, skills, and interests related to software and web development.

I began connecting with peers, lecturers, and industry professionals, focusing on meaningful interactions.

I reviewed examples of good networking etiquette, including the CAR and STAR methods for self-presentation.

I actively engaged by liking and commenting on IT-related posts to stay visible and involved in the professional community.

## Result
