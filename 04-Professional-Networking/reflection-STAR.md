# STAR Reflection: Professional Networking
## Situation

At the beginning of the PRP370S module in early 2025, I was required to develop professional networking skills as part of my work readiness training. As a final-year Diploma in Information and Communication Technology student at Cape Peninsula University of Technology, I recognized that technical skills alone would not be sufficient for success in the IT industry.

Prior to this training, my professional networking experience was minimal. I had limited understanding of how to build and maintain professional relationships strategically. I had minimal experience with:

-Creating and maintaining a professional online presence
-Using LinkedIn and other professional networking platforms effectively
-Understanding networking etiquette and best practices
-Leveraging networking for career opportunities and professional development

The IT industry is highly collaborative and relationship-driven. Career opportunities often emerge through professional connections, referrals, and industry relationships rather than solely through formal job applications. Employers value candidates who can build networks, collaborate effectively, and engage with the professional community. I needed to transition from having no professional network to actively building a strategic online presence and understanding how to create meaningful professional connections.

During early 2025, I completed the Professional Networking module, which emphasized building an online professional presence through platforms like LinkedIn, understanding the principles of effective networking, and developing authentic professional relationships. Before this module, I was not actively engaging on LinkedIn.

## Task

The main objectives were to:

Understand the purpose of professional networking.

Create a LinkedIn profile that reflects my personal brand and professional identity.

Learn the “Golden Rule” of networking — giving value before expecting opportunities.

Avoid common networking mistakes such as lack of preparation or self-centered communication.

Build and maintain authentic professional relationships within the IT industry.

Professional communication etiquette in networking contexts.

Achieve mastery of professional networking concepts as evidenced by assessment performance

Apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations through creation of professional networking materials

Personal Development Goal:
Transform from a student with no professional network to an active networker with a strong online presence, ready to build authentic relationships that support long-term career growth in the IT industry.

I am confident that these interview skills will serve as a foundation for my entire IT career.
