# STAR Reflection: Interview Skills

## Situation

At the beginning of the PRP370S module in early 2025, I was required to develop professional interview skills as part of my work readiness training. As a final-year Diploma in Information and Communication Technology (DPICT) student at Cape Peninsula University of Technology, I recognized that technical skills alone would not be sufficient for success in the IT industry.

Prior to this training, my interview preparation experience was minimal. I had never participated in a formal interview process and lacked confidence in structuring coherent responses to scenario-based questions. I had limited experience with:
Behavioral and situational interview questions
Structured response frameworks like the CAR method
Professional CV preparation and formatting
Company research and interview preparation strategies
Discussing weaknesses and challenges professionally

In April 2025, I completed the Interview Skills module, which included theoretical learning through quizzes, practical application through CV preparation and cover letter writing, and mock interview exercises. This presented a structured opportunity to develop critical competencies needed for real-world job applications and interviews in the competitive IT job market.

## Task

The objective was to demonstrate competency in professional interview skills, including:

Understanding the purpose of interviews and what employers are evaluating.

Applying the CAR method (Context, Action, Result) to answer behavioral questions effectively.

Researching companies to tailor responses and demonstrate preparation.

Practicing answers to common questions, such as “Tell me about yourself” and “What is your greatest weakness?”

Develop a professional CV that adheres to industry standards and formatting conventions, effectively showcases qualifications and achievements, use achievement-oriented language rather than mere responsibility listing and cv ready for submission to real internship programs and entry-level positions.

The overarching goal was to build confidence and readiness for real-world interviews while producing evidence for my digital portfolio.
