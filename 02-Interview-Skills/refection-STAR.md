# STAR Reflection: Interview Skills
## Situation

As a final-year student in the Diploma in Information and Communication Technology (DPICT) at Cape Peninsula University of Technology, I needed to develop professional interview skills as part of my work readiness training (PRP370S).

Entering the IT industry requires more than technical ability; employers evaluate candidates on communication, professionalism, and how they respond to behavioral questions. At the start, my interview preparation experience was limited, and I lacked confidence in structuring answers for scenario-based questions.

In April 2025, I completed the Interview Skills module, which included a quiz, CV preparation, cover letter writing, and mock interview exercises. This presented an opportunity to apply learned strategies in a practical context.

# Task

The objective was to demonstrate competency in professional interview skills, including:

Understanding the purpose of interviews and what employers are evaluating.

Applying the CAR method (Context, Action, Result) to answer behavioral questions effectively.

Researching companies to tailor responses and demonstrate preparation.

Practicing answers to common questions, such as “Tell me about yourself” and “What is your greatest weakness?”

Preparing a professional CV aligned with industry standards.

The overarching goal was to build confidence and readiness for real-world interviews while producing evidence for my digital portfolio.

# Action

To achieve these objectives, I took the following steps:

Phase 1: Learning and Understanding

Reviewed all module resources on interview techniques, behavioral questions, and company research.

Studied the CAR method to structure responses to scenario-based questions.

Analyzed sample answers to “Tell me about yourself” and “greatest weakness” questions.

Phase 2: Practical Application

Completed the Interview Skills Quiz, achieving 100% on most questions and identifying areas needing improvement (e.g., handling weakness questions).

Drafted and polished my CV according to professional standards.

Practiced answering behavioral questions out loud, applying the CAR method to provide structured and concise answers.

Simulated mock interview sessions to enhance confidence and verbal communication skills.

Phase 3: Reflection and Improvement

Reviewed quiz results and mock interview notes to identify strengths and weaknesses.

Adjusted my answers for clarity, tone, and professionalism.

Focused on improving responses to difficult questions and articulating achievements effectively.

# Result

The actions I took produced the following outcomes:
