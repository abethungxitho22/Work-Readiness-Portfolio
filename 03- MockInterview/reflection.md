# STAR Reflection: Mock Interview Preparation

## Situation

At the beginning of the PRP370S module in early 2025, I was required to develop practical interview skills as part of my work readiness training. As a final year Diploma in Information and Communication Technology student at Cape Peninsula University of Technology, I recognized that theoretical knowledge of interview techniques alone would not be sufficient for success in real IT industry interviews.

Prior to this training, my interview experience was purely theoretical. I had studied the CAR/STAR methods and learned about professional interview responses, but I had never practiced these skills in a realistic interview scenario. I had limited experience with:
-Answering interview questions on camera or in formal settings
-Articulating my qualifications and experiences under pressure
-Managing nervousness and maintaining composure during interviews
-Responding to behavioral and technical questions simultaneously
-Presenting myself professionally in video interview formats
-Evaluating and improving my own interview performance

The IT industry increasingly uses video interviews as part of the recruitment process, particularly for initial screening stages. Employers evaluate not only the content of responses but also communication skills, confidence, professional presentation, and ability to think clearly under pressure. I needed to transition from theoretical understanding to practical demonstration of interview competency, particularly in articulating my technical qualifications while maintaining professional communication standards.

During the module, I was required to prepare and record a mock interview video demonstrating my ability to respond to common IT interview questions. This exercise required me to respond to five key questions that are frequently asked in IT interviews: "Tell me about yourself," "How can your greatest strength help you in this role?" "What certifications do you hold relevant to this position?" "Give me an example of a time you had to prioritize certain tasks or projects over others," and "What tools do you typically need to diagnose problems in your field?" This mock interview presented both an opportunity to practice interview skills and a challenge to perform professionally on camera.

## Task

My tasks and responsibilities included:

This mock interview exercise demonstrates my comprehensive understanding of professional self-presentation and interview communication skills. I practiced introducing myself effectively, highlighting key aspects of my background while maintaining a confident and professional demeanor. Throughout the exercise, I articulated my strengths in relation to specific job requirements and presented my qualifications and certifications in a clear and relevant manner. I applied behavioral question frameworks such as the CAR and STAR methods to structure scenario-based responses, ensuring that my answers were focused, reflective, and results-oriented. Additionally, I demonstrated the ability to discuss technical competencies with clarity and confidence, showcasing both my knowledge and communication skills. Overall, the exercise reflects my readiness to perform professionally in virtual or in-person interviews by combining effective communication, self-awareness, and technical understanding.

Prepare structured responses to five specific interview questions:

1.Tell me about yourself (professional introduction)
2.How can your greatest strength help you in this role? (strengths analysis)
3.What certifications do you hold relevant to this position? (qualifications presentation)
4.Give me an example of a time you had to prioritize tasks or projects (behavioral/STAR question)
5.What tools do you typically need to diagnose problems in your field? (technical competency)

In this practical component, I demonstrated interview readiness by applying learned techniques in a realistic mock interview scenario. I effectively managed nervousness and maintained composure while speaking on camera, ensuring a confident and professional presence. Throughout the exercise, I balanced technical detail with clear, accessible communication to engage the interviewer and convey my understanding effectively. I also presented an authentic professional identity by expressing my genuine career interests and personal strengths. Furthermore, I showcased thorough preparation and research into IT industry requirements, aligning my responses with current professional expectations and demonstrating both industry awareness and self-assured communication skills.

Personal Development Goal:
Transform from a student with theoretical interview knowledge to a confident candidate capable of presenting myself professionally in video interview formats, articulating my qualifications clearly, and responding effectively to diverse question types.

## Action

To successfully complete the mock interview exercise, I took the following specific actions:

Phase 1: Preparation and Research

During the preparation and research phase, I focused on developing a strong understanding of interview expectations and question types commonly used in professional settings. I began by reviewing various interview question categories and analyzing the five core questions to determine what each was evaluating. These questions addressed professional introduction, strengths assessment, qualifications verification, behavioral competency, and technical knowledge. To strengthen my responses, I researched common follow-up questions and studied what employers typically look for in IT candidate interviews.

During the recording phase, I delivered structured and well-prepared responses to each interview question.

For Question 1: “Tell me about yourself,” I introduced myself as a final-year DPICT student at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, highlighting my academic background, key technical skills, and areas of interest such as software and web development. I concluded by linking my experience and skills to my long-term career goals within the IT industry.

In Question 2: “How can your greatest strength help you in this role?” I identified a specific strength relevant to IT work and supported it with a concrete example from my academic projects. I clearly explained how this strength aligns with the demands of IT positions, demonstrating both self-awareness and an understanding of professional expectations.
